# Youtube automation using Selenium

# Automating YouTube Music with Selenium in Python allows you to easily control and manipulate the playback of songs on the platform. This can be a great way to quickly and easily create a personalized listening experience without having to manually navigate through the website.

## Prerequisites:

## Modules:

 ### Selenium : Automation of browsers
 ### localStoragePy : Storing small strings permanently in JSON format

## Browsers:

### Firefox :
Since Google Chrome does not allow extensions to be used in headless mode [when the browser is running in the background], we must use a different browser such as Firefox in order to utilize extensions with Selenium.

## GeckoDriver:

In order to automate Firefox using Selenium, we must install Geckodriver.exe, which is the official browser automation engine for Selenium.

In order to stream music without ads using our webdriver, we need to enable an ad blocker extension. To do this, we will need to obtain a .xpi file for the desired ad blocker extension. The .xpi file is a type of compressed file that contains the extension and its components. You can follow the Step 1 at the linked webpage to learn how to obtain the .xpi file for your extension.


### I have written a blog post about the implementaion. Will update the link here after it gets published, or will share the writeup if it gets rejected.
